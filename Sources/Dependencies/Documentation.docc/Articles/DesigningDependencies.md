# Designing dependencies

Learn techniques on designing your dependencies so that they are most flexible for injecting into
features and overriding for tests.

## Overview

Making it possible to control your dependencies is the most important step you can take towards
making your features isolatable and testable. The second most important step after that is to design
your dependencies in a way that maximizes their flexibility in tests and other situations.

# Altenative approaches to interfaces

The most popular way to design dependencies in Swift is to use protocols. For example, if your
feature needs to interact with an audio player, you might design a protocol with methods for
playing, stopping, and more:

```swift
protocol AudioPlayer {
  func loop(_ url: URL) async throws
  func play(_ url: URL) async throws
  func setVolume(_ volume: Float) async
  func stop() async
}
```

Then you are free to make as many conformances of this protocol as you want, such as a
`LiveAudioPlayer` that actually interacts with AVFoundation, or a `MockAudioPlayer` that doesn't
play any sounds, but does suspend in order to simulate that something is playing. You could even
have an `UnimplementedAudioPlayer` conformance that invokes `XCTFail` when any method is invoked:

```swift
struct LiveAudioPlayer: AudioPlayer {
  let audioEngine: AVAudioEngine
  // ...
}
struct MockAudioPlayer: AudioPlayer {
  // ...
}
struct UnimplementedAudioPlayer: AudioPlayer {
  func loop(_ url: URL) async throws {
    XCTFail("AudioPlayer.loop is unimplemented")
  }
  // ...
}
```

And all of those conformances can be used to specify the live, preview and test values for the
dependency:

```swift
private enum AudioPlayerKey: DependencyKey {
  static let liveValue: any AudioPlayer = LiveAudioPlayer()
  static let previewValue: any AudioPlayer = MockAudioPlayer()
  static let testValue: any AudioPlayer = UnimplementedAudioPlayer()
}
```

> implementations of your dependencies.

This style of dependencies works just fine, and if it is what you are most comfortable with then
there is no need to change.

However, there is a small change one can make to this dependency to unlock even more power. Rather
than designing the audio player as a protocol, we can use a struct with closure properties to
represent the interface:

```swift
struct AudioPlayerClient {
  var loop: (_ url: URL) async throws -> Void
  var play: (_ url: URL) async throws -> Void
  var setVolume: (_ volume: Float) async -> Void
  var stop: () async -> Void
}
```

Then, rather than defining types that conform to the protocol you construct values:

```swift
extension AudioPlayerClient {
  static var live: Self {
    let audioEngine: AVAudioEngine
    return Self(/*...*/)
  }

  static let mock = Self(/* ... */)

  static let unimplemented = Self(
    loop: { _ in XCTFail("AudioPlayerClient.loop is unimplemented") },
    // ...
  )
}
```

Then, to register this dependency you can leverage the `AudioPlayerClient` struct to conform
to the ``DependencyKey`` protocol. There's no need to define a new type. In fact, you can even 
define the live, preview and test values directly in the conformance, all at once:

```swift
extension AudioPlayerClient: DependencyKey {
  static var liveValue: Self {
    let audioEngine: AVAudioEngine
    return Self(/*...*/)
  }

  static let previewValue = Self(/* ... */)

  static let testValue = Self(
    loop: unimplemented("AudioPlayerClient.loop"),
    play: unimplemented("AudioPlayerClient.play"),
    setVolume: unimplemented("AudioPlayerClient.setVolume"),
    stop: unimplemented("AudioPlayerClient.stop")
  )
}

extension DependencyValues {
  var audioPlayer: AudioPlayerClient {
    get { self[AudioPlayerClient.self] }
    set { self[AudioPlayerClient.self] = newValue }
  }
}
```

> pattern.

If you design your dependencies in this way you can pick which dependency endpoints you need in your
feature. For example, if you have a feature that needs an audio player to do its job, but it only
needs the `play` endpoint, and doesn't need to loop, set volume or stop audio, then you can specify
a dependency on just that one function:

```swift
final class FeatureModel: ObservableObject {
  @Dependency(\.audioPlayer.play) var play
  // ...
}
```

This can allow your features to better describe the minimal interface they need from dependencies,
which can help a feature seem less intimidating.

You can also override the bare minimum of the dependency in tests. For example, suppose that one
user flow of your feature you are testing invokes the `play` endpoint, but you don't think any other
endpoint will be called. Then you can write a test that overrides only that one single endpoint:

```swift
func testFeature() {
  let isPlaying = ActorIsolated(false)

  let model = withDependencies {
    $0.audioPlayer.play = { _ in await isPlaying.setValue(true) }
  } operation: {
    FeatureModel()
  }

  await model.play()
  XCTAssertEqual(isPlaying.value, true)
}
```

If this test passes you can be guaranteed that no other endpoints of the dependency are used in the
user flow you are testing. If someday in the future more of the dependency is used, you will
instantly get a test failure, letting you know that there is more behavior that you must assert on.

# Generic dependencies

A generic dependency is one that requires a generic in its interface in some way. This can occur
if you want to model the interface as a struct with a generic, or a protocol with an associated
type, or even just if a method needs a generic. Such dependencies are significantly more complicated
than a non-generic interface, both in terms of how they are provided to features and how one 
provides alternative conconformances for tests, previews, etc.

For example, you may have a file client that deals with JSON files on the disk, and could model
that with the following protocol:

```swift
protocol JSONFileClient {
  func save<Model: Encodable>(_ model: Model, to url: URL) throws
  func load<Model: Decodable>(from url: URL) throws -> Model
}
```

A "live" implementation of this that actually reaches out to the file system might look like this:

```swift
struct LiveJSONFileClient: JSONFileClient {
  func save<Model: Encodable>(_ model: Model, to url: URL) throws {
    try JSONEncoder().encode(model).write(to: url)
  }
  func load<Model: Decodable>(from url: URL) throws -> Model {
    try JSONDecoder().decode(Model.self, from: Data(contentsOf: url))
  }
} 
```

This kind of dependency does not easily translate to the struct-style of interfaces because `var`
and `let` properties in Swift cannot have generics:

```swift
struct JSONFileClient {
  var save<Model: Encodable>: (Model, URL) throws -> Void  // ðŸ›‘
  var load<Model: Decodable>: (URL) throws -> Model        // ðŸ›‘
}
```

That may seem unfortunate, but it turns out it's not such a bad thing that this is not possible.
The problem with generic interfaces like the `JSONFileClient` protocol is that they are incredibly
difficult to mock for tests and previews.

If you wanted to write a test for a feature that uses a `JSONFileClient` instance, then you would
want to provide a mock so that you do not interact directly with the file system. Doing so can help
prevent mysterious test failures where the changes one test makes to the file system bleeds over
into another test.

So what you would want to do is have a `MockJSONFileClient` conformance of the `JSONFileClient`
protocol that does not read and write to the file system, but stead 

```swift
class MockJSONFileClient: JSONFileClient {
  var storage: Any?
  func save<Model: Encodable>(_ model: Model, to url: URL) throws {
    self.storage = model
  }
  func load<Model: Decodable>(from url: URL) throws -> Model {
    guard let storage, let model = storage as? Model
    else {
      struct CastError: Error {}
      throw CastError()
    }
    return model
  }
}
```



---


Another example is some kind of media player interface that provides endpoints for loading, playing
and stopping a piece of media, such as a video or audio file:


```swift
protocol MediaPlayer {
  associatedtype Media: MediaProtocol
  var media: Media
  init(media: Media)
  func load()
  func stop()
  func play()
}
```
